# AST 426: Lecture Files

This repository contains lecture materials for the course **AST 426: Technology Applications for Precision Agriculture**, taught by **Dr. Pappu Kumar Yadav**. These files are designed to support learning and reference for students enrolled in the course.

## Course Overview

AST 426 is an in-depth study of technologies that enable precision agriculture. Topics include:

- Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
- Sensors for yield, quality, soil, and crop properties as applied to crop production
- Controls for variable rate applications and automatic control
- Communication networks for increasingly connected off-road machines

The course focuses on the integration of advanced technologies to improve agricultural efficiency and productivity.
